//! # tudelft quadrupel support library
//!
//! This library re-exports some crates (see below). That just makes it
//! easy for your drone code to use those libraries. For example:
//! ```
//! use tudelft_quadrupel::cortex_m;
//! ```

/// * red blinking: you probably have a panic
/// * blue blinking: your code is probably running fine

///   this is never turned off. If a panic happens and yellow is on, initialization likely failed
/// * green on + red blinking: an allocation happened causing a panic.
